### Hi there, I am Ajay! ðŸ‘‹

#### Who Am I?
I am a fifteen-year-old `Full Stack Developer` from Minnesota (ðŸ¥¶) that loves to develop software, applications, work and innovate on things that I am passionate about. 

The main tools and languages I use are HTML, CSS, Javascript, GoLang, Python, NodeJS, Typescript, NextJS, Electron, React, jQuery, Angular, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, Cosmos, Microsoft Azure Cloud Infrastructure, and Amazon AWS. I also love exploring the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning!

I don't always update this github account, so please make sure to look at my [twitter](https://twitter.com/tamperable) to see what I am up to. 

Make sure to check out my motives, other projects, and more on [my website](https://ajaymsra.com/)!
