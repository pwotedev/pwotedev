### Hi there, I am Ajay! ðŸ‘‹

# Who Am I?
I am a fifteen-year-old `Full Stack Developer` from Minnesota (ðŸ¥¶) that loves to develop software, applications, and work and innovate on things that I am passionate in. 

The main tools and languages I use are HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Typescript, NextJS, Electron, React, jQuery, Angular, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, Cosmos, Microsoft Azure Cloud Infrastructure, and Amazon AWS. 

I don't always update this github account, so please make sure to check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/tamperable) to see what I am up to. 

Make sure to check out my motives, other projects, and more at https://ajaymsra.com/!
